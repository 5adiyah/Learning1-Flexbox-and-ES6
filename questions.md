**Questions I've Looked up**

- How to add trigger an event on hover
  `foo.addEventListener('mouseenter', function(e){}`

- What's the difference between mouseenter and mouseover?
  -- *Mouseover* Will fire upon entering an element and whenever any mouse movements occur within the element.
  -- *Mouseenter* Will fire upon entering an element.
  -- Each time your mouse enters or leaves a child element, mouseover is triggered, but not mouseenter.
